<b>API Instructions:</b> 
This app runs with the help of three APIs (application programming interfaces). The Google Civic API for your state and federal government representatives, the Open States API to pull in detailed information around your local district representatives, and the geocode.xyz API to convert the inputted address to latitude and longitude values which is needed for the Open States API. You will need to create an API key for each one of these APIs to gain access to their data and services. The API key should be stored in your .env file using these variable names: REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CIVIC_API, REACT_APP_OPENSTATES_API and REACT_APP_GEOCODE_API. View the links below to learn how to create an API key as well as how to appropriately use each one of these APIs.
